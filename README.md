Automated Resume Relevance Check System
An intelligent, AI-powered system designed to automate the tedious process of resume screening. This tool helps recruiters make faster, data-driven, and unbiased hiring decisions by scoring and analyzing resumes against job descriptions.

📽️ Demo
🎯 The Problem
In today's competitive job market, a single job posting can attract hundreds of resumes. Manually screening each one is:

Time-Consuming: Recruiters spend countless hours on repetitive filtering tasks.

Inconsistent: Evaluations can vary significantly between different recruiters.

Prone to Bias: Unconscious biases can lead to overlooking qualified candidates.

Lacks Feedback: Candidates, especially students, rarely receive constructive feedback to help them improve.

This project, developed for Innomatics Research Labs, aims to solve these challenges by leveraging the power of Generative AI.

✨ Features
AI-Powered Relevance Score: Generates a quantitative score (0-100) indicating how well a resume matches a job description.

Hybrid Analysis Engine: Combines traditional keyword matching (Hard Match) with contextual understanding (Semantic Match) for superior accuracy.

Gap Analysis: Clearly identifies key skills and qualifications from the job description that are missing in the resume.

Personalized AI Feedback: Provides actionable, constructive feedback for candidates to help them improve their resumes.

Interactive Web Dashboard: A clean, modern, and easy-to-use interface for uploading documents and viewing results.

Multi-Format Support: Accepts resumes and job descriptions in both PDF and DOCX formats.

⚙️ How It Works
The system follows a three-step workflow to provide a comprehensive analysis:

Data Ingestion: The user uploads a job description and a resume. The backend extracts clean text from these files using specialized parsers.

Relevance Analysis: The core AI engine processes the text.

The Hard Match module scans for direct keyword matches.

The Semantic Match module uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and a vector store to understand the contextual relevance between the two documents.

Output & Dashboard: The system combines the scores from both modules, generates a final verdict and personalized feedback, and displays everything on the user-friendly dashboard.
